# Functions

The aleutcss `functions` module—like `mixins`—contains a few framework functions
that are **required** for using any of the rest of aleutcss.

These 4 functions basically multiplies a given number (mostly the base-spacing)
by 4 or 2, or divide them by 2 or 4.


## Install using npm:

```ssh
    $ npm install --save-dev aleut-functions
```
